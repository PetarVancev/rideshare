# 🚗 Rideshare.mk

**Rideshare.mk** was a web-based ridesharing platform designed to connect drivers and passengers for shared trips across North Macedonia.  
Although the startup did not continue, this repository remains an open-source reference of the project’s development — a complete implementation of a modern, full-stack ridesharing web app.

> **Note:** A previous version of the platform included **digital POS terminal integration**, which can be explored in earlier commits.  
> The original project was developed in **Macedonian**; this README and the current demo version have been **quickly translated to English** for demonstration purposes.
